The flag has a width-to-length ratio of approximately 2 to 3. Various myths are associated with the symbolism of the red colour and the star and crescent, but none really explains their origins. Although the star and crescent are often seen as typical Muslim symbols, in fact they have a history long predating the rise of Islam. Ancient civilizations throughout the Middle East used a crescent moon as a religious symbol, and the ancient city of Byzantium was dedicated to the moon goddess,  Diana . A star, emblematic of the Virgin Mary, was added to Diana\xe2\x80\x99s crescent symbol when Emperor  Constantine I  made Christianity the official faith of the Roman Empire and renamed the city Constantinople in his own honour. The crescent and star became associated with Islam when the Muslim  Turkic peoples  of Central Asia captured the Anatolian peninsula (and, eventually, Constantinople) and added the crescent and star of the latter to their own plain red flags. There were several Turkish flags throughout the centuries of the Ottoman Empire, most of them incorporating the crescent and star and the colours red or green. In June 1793 the flag now used as the Turkish national flag was established for the navy, although its star had eight points instead of the current five. The reduction in the number of star points was made about 1844. That flag design was reconfirmed as the Turkish national banner on June 5, 1936, following the revolution led by  Atat\xc3\xbcrk , who had established a republic in 1923 after the collapse of the Ottoman dynasty.
