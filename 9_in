The Turkish version of its name - "T\xc3\xbcrkiye"- is derived from the amalgamation of two words - "T\xc3\xbcrk"and the suffix "-iye".  The former simply means \'strong\', while the suffix is possessive in nature and pertains to being an \'owner\'. The nation of Turkey was concretely established by Mustafa Kemal Atat\xc3\xbcrk, in 1923, subsequently to Ottoman decline.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe part of the country that lies in Asia is called Anatolia while the European section is called Thrace. \n \n \r\nTurkey is a trans-continental nation, half of it being in Asia and another half in Europe. So it can be called a Eurasian country. Turkey has a diverse landscape of coasts, mountains, plains and peninsulas. The Anatolian peninsula is almost a national trademark, with its stark ruggedness and aridity it rises to a plateau surrounded by contracted coastal plains. The country of Turkey is comprises of seven sections based on the region it surrounds or the region that surrounds it. They are the Aegean region, the Marmara region, the Mediterranean region, East Anatolia, Central Anatolia, Southeast Anatolia and the Black Sea region. There are mountain ranges in the east that are the birth places for many a river, namely the Euphrates, Tigris, Araks and also Lake Van. The highest point in Turkey is Mount Arat.  \n Where is Turkey \r\nThe land of Turkey lies spread out across the southern region of two continents - east of Europe and west of Asia. As a result it also covers two significant landscapes - the Anatolian peninsula and the Balkans. Its immediate political and watery neighbors are (clockwise from the west) Armenia, Iran and Azerbaijan to the east; Iraq and Syria to southeast; the Mediterranean Sea to the south; the Aegean Sea to the southwest; the Sea of Marmara and the country of Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; and the Black Sea to the north. \n Climate of Turkey \r\nTurkey has clement weather almost the whole year round. It can be summed up in the phrase \'Mediterranean\'. Summers are hot and dry, while the winters are wet and cold. However, inland-wards, the conditions get arid and continental, with demarcated seasonal changes, due to the mountainous barrier near the coast. Precipitation in the form of snowfall is experienced inland at higher altitudes. The month of May experiences the most rainfall. \r\n Flora and Fauna of Turkey \r\nA country of rich diversity, Turkey has a huge inventory of plants and animals thriving in the country. This rich biodiversity includes trees, flowers, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds and fishes. To begin with the kind of plants that populate the country of Turkmenistan; some of the wide spread species include the alder, beech, Scots pine, oak, Oriental spruce, maple, flax, plums, apricots, hazelnuts, figs, almonds and sour cherries. Among flowers, those that populate the list are violets, daisies, poppies, crocuses and sunflowers. As a direct result of all the flowers that are to be seen, butterflies too are aplenty. Animal fauna is just as diverse with some unique and rare species living in the land. Some of these are Anatolia leopard, wild sheep, tiger, lions, fallow deer; the rare species are the Kangal dog and the Van cat - a cat with one blue and one green. Avian fauna in Turkey consists of pheasant, storks, dalmatian pelican, pygmy cormorants, the slender billed curlew, bald ibis, flamingoes, wild ducks and geese. There are some other species of fauna like the loggerhead turtles,Chelonia mydas and Caretta caretta sea turtles and monk seals which are not just singular but also rare to spot anywhere across the globe.  \n People of Turkey \r\nThe majority of the people of Turkey are original inhabitants of the land. However, there are people of other ethnicities too to be found. All these people have attained citizenship of Turkey through the Treaty of Lausanne. Some of the other ethnic races are Greeks, Armenians, Jews, Abkhazians, Syriacs, Albanians, Arabs, Roma, Bosniaks, Pomaks, Chechens, Ossetians, Circassians, Levantines, Kabardin, Georgians, Laz, Hamshenis, Zazas and the Kurds.  \n  MOW-728-Ad-Unit-2  \n  MOW-728-Ad-Unit-2  \n \n \n \n Arts, Culture and Music of Turkey  \n \n Art :  the indigenous arts in Turkey, though influenced can be clearly seen in their kilim works, traditional Anatolian jewellery, carpet weaving, Canakkale ceramic-ware, hand made dolls, matting, metal bead works called G\xc3\xbcherse, tiles, ceramics, making of Aydin needle lace of, Onyx sculptures, hand crafted filigree silver ware and traditional Yatagan Swords .  \n Culture :  the dominant traits of Turkey\'s culture are derived primarily from Ottoman, Islamic and Christian-European influences. One of the chief markers of Turkey\'s culture is its cuisine. Turkey\'s cuisine has all the traits of nations that fell under the Ottoman Empire. So, there are as many Asian flavors to be deciphered as there are European.  \n Music :  the music of Turkey is a commingling of influences from the Arabic, classical Persian, Balkan, ancient Byzantine, Central Asian folk and modern European.   \n \r\nAmong the other influences in their folk music, elements and traits pertaining to Armenians, Greeks, Kurdish, Polish, Azeri and Jewish can be detected. \n Turkey Flag    \r\nTurkey has a flag that is both simple yet bold. It consists of a stark blood-red backdrop and on it, in the center-left of the flag, is superimposed a white crescent moon and in the center a white five-point star. The color red is reminiscent of the fallen Ottoman Empire, while the moon and the star is an Islamic insignia.  \n Economy of Turkey \r\nTurkey\'s economy is dependent on a two different aspects of its country\'s heritage. While the time-honored agricultural segment is a major contributor, so are the new industrial sectors of banking, transport, and communications. Together they take turkey\'s economy the strength it possesses. The agricultural produce that is of utmost value is tobacco, sugar beets, cotton, olives, pulse, grain and citrus. Other industries which have export value include textiles; processing and packaging of food; transport equipment; electronic goods; mining of coal, chromites, copper, boron and iron ore; steel; petroleum; construction and construction materials; lumber and paper. Aside of all these commodities, tourism is another flourishing revenue earner. \r\n \n  content end  \n \n \n \n \n  300-TAN  \n \n \n \n  MOW-300-Admeld-1  \n  /1152375/MOW-300-Admeld-1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n main-rightpanel ends  \n \n \n  Footer Starts Here  \r\n\xef\xbb\xbf \n  popup-Ad start \n \n \n  /1152375/MOW-popunder  \n \n \n \n popup-Ad end \n new ad code \n \n new ad code \n Mobile Direct Add Code start \n \n \n  /1152375/MOW-300x600-mobile  \n \n Mobile Direct Add Code end \n  Start Gutter space ad  \n \n \n \n \n  MOW-Left  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  120-2nd-ad  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  End Gutter space ad  \n  saved from url=(0022)http://internet.e-mail  \n  Footer Starts Here  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n FAQs and Answers on History and Geography \n \n \n \n \n \n What are some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most endangered species? \n \n \n \n What are the top 20 water parks in the world? \n \n \n \n How deep are the 5 Great Lakes of North America? \n \n \n \n What is the International Date Line? \n \n \n \n \n \n store products widget start \n \n \n store products widget end \n \n \n \n  /1152375/MOW-inread  \n \n \n \n \n \n popup alert \n \n popup alert \n \n \r\n"By clicking OK or by using this Website, you consent to the use of cookies.
