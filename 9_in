Throughout its history it has acted as both a barrier and a bridge between the two continents. [P1] Encyclop\xc3\xa6dia Britannica, Inc. The Castle of St. Peter at Bodrum, Turkey, on the Aegean coast. \xc2\xa9 Monticelllo/Dreamstime.com [ML1] Turkey is situated at the crossroads of the  Balkans ,  Caucasus ,  Middle East , and eastern  Mediterranean . It is among the larger countries of the region in terms of territory and population, and its land area is greater than that of any European state. Nearly all of the country is in Asia,  comprising  the oblong peninsula of Asia Minor\xe2\x80\x94also known as  Anatolia  (Anadolu)\xe2\x80\x94and, in the east, part of a mountainous region sometimes known as the  Armenian Highland . The remainder\xe2\x80\x94Turkish  Thrace  (Trakya)\xe2\x80\x94lies in the extreme southeastern part of Europe, a tiny remnant of an empire that once extended over much of the Balkans. [P2] Turkey Encyclop\xc3\xa6dia Britannica, Inc. [ML2] The country has a north-south extent that ranges from about 300 to 400 miles (480 to 640 km), and it stretches about 1,000 miles from west to east. Turkey is bounded on the north by the  Black Sea , on the northeast by  Georgia  and  Armenia , on the east by  Azerbaijan  and  Iran , on the southeast by  Iraq  and  Syria , on the southwest and west by the  Mediterranean Sea  and the  Aegean Sea , and on the northwest by  Greece  and  Bulgaria . The capital is  Ankara , and its largest city and seaport is  Istanbul . [P3] Turkey Overview of Turkey. Contunico \xc2\xa9 ZDF Enterprises GmbH, Mainz Time-lapse video of Istanbul.

Contunico \xc2\xa9 ZDF Enterprises GmbH, Mainz [ML3] Of a total boundary length of some 4,000 miles (6,440 km), about three-fourths is maritime, including coastlines along the Black Sea, the Aegean, and the Mediterranean, as well as the narrows that link the Black and Aegean seas. These narrows\xe2\x80\x94which include the  Bosporus , the  Sea of Marmara , and the  Dardanelles \xe2\x80\x94are known collectively as the  Turkish straits;  Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s  control of the straits, the only outlet from the Black Sea, has been a major factor in its relations with other states. Most of the islands along the Aegean coast are Greek; only the islands of  G\xc3\xb6k\xc3\xa7eada  and Bozcaada remain in Turkish hands. The maritime boundary with Greece has been a source of dispute between the two countries on numerous occasions since  World War II .

Turkmen tribes invaded Anatolia in the 11th century  ce , founding the  Seljuq  empire; during the 14th century the Ottoman Empire began a long expansion, reaching its peak during the 17th century. The modern Turkish  republic , founded in 1923 after the collapse of the  Ottoman Empire , is a nationalist,  secular ,  parliamentary democracy . After a period of one-party rule under its founder,  Mustafa Kemal (Atat\xc3\xbcrk) , and his successor, Turkish governments since the 1950s have been produced by multiparty elections based on universal adult suffrage. [P5] The Ottoman Empire at its greatest extent. Encyclop\xc3\xa6dia Britannica, Inc. [ML5] \n Land \n Relief \n Turkey is a predominantly mountainous country, and true lowland is confined to the coastal fringes. About one-fourth of the surface has an elevation above 4,000 feet (1,200 metres), and less than two-fifths lies below 1,500 feet (460 metres). Mountain crests exceed 7,500 feet (2,300 metres) in many places, particularly in the east, where Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s highest mountain,  Mount Ararat  (A\xc4\x9fr\xc4\xb1), reaches 16,945 feet (5,165 metres) close to the borders with Armenia and Iran. In the southeast the Uludoruk Peak reaches 15,563 feet (4,744 metres); though further west, the Demirkaz\xc4\xb1k Peak (12,320 feet [3,755 metres]) and Mount Aydos (11,414 feet [3,479 metres]) are also significant peaks. Steep slopes are common throughout the country, and flat or gently sloping land makes up barely one-sixth of the total area. These relief features affect other aspects of the physical  environment , producing climates often much harsher than might be expected for a country of Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s  latitude  and reducing the availability and productivity of agricultural land. Structurally, the country lies within the geologically young folded-mountain zone of Eurasia, which in Turkey trends predominantly east to west. The geology of Turkey is complex, with sedimentary rocks ranging from  Paleozoic  to  Quaternary , numerous intrusions, and extensive areas of volcanic material. Four main regions can be identified: the northern folded zone, the southern folded zone, the central massif, and the Arabian platform. [P6] Encyclop\xc3\xa6dia Britannica, Inc. [ML6] \n The northern folded zone \n The northern folded zone  comprises  a series of mountain ridges, increasing in elevation toward the east, that occupy a belt about 90 to 125 miles (145 to 200 km) wide immediately south of the Black Sea. The system as a whole is referred to as the  Pontic Mountains  (Do\xc4\x9fukaradeniz Da\xc4\x9flar\xc4\xb1). In the west the system has been fractured by the faulting that produced the Turkish straits; in Thrace the Ergene lowlands are among the largest in the country, and the main mountain range\xe2\x80\x94the  Y\xc4\xb1ld\xc4\xb1z (Istranca)\xe2\x80\x94reaches only 3,379 feet (1,030 metres). Lowlands also occur to the south of the Sea of Marmara and along the lower Sakarya River east of the Bosporus. High ridges trending east-west rise abruptly from the Black Sea coast, and the coastal plain is thus narrow, opening out only in the deltas of the  K\xc4\xb1z\xc4\xb1l  and  Ye\xc5\x9fil rivers. These rivers break through the mountain barrier in a zone of weakness where summits are below 2,000 feet (600 metres), dividing the Pontic Mountains into western and eastern sections. In the western section, between the  Sakarya  and K\xc4\xb1z\xc4\xb1l rivers, there are four main ridges: the  K\xc3\xbcre,  Bolu,  Ilgaz, and  K\xc3\xb6ro\xc4\x9flu mountains. East of the Ye\xc5\x9fil the system is higher, narrower, and steeper. Less than 50 miles from the coast, peaks rise to more than 10,000 feet (3,000 metres), with a maximum elevation of 12,917 feet (3,937 metres) in the Ka\xc3\xa7kar range. Separated by the narrow trough of the Kelkit and \xc3\x87oruh river valleys stands a second ridge that rises above 8,000 feet (2,400 metres). [P7] \n The southern folded zone \n The southern folded zone occupies the southern third of the country, from the Aegean to the Gulf of Iskenderun, from which it extends to the northeast and east around the northern side of the Arabian platform. Over most of its length, the Mediterranean coastal plain is narrow, but there are two major lowland embayments. The  Antalya Plain extends inland some 20 miles (30 km) from the Gulf of Antalya; the  Adana Plain , measuring roughly 90 by 60 miles (145 by 100 km), comprises the combined deltas of the Seyhan and  Ceyhan  rivers. The mountain system falls into two main parts. West of  Antalya  a complex series of ridges with a north-south trend reaches 6,500 to 8,200 feet (2,000 to 2,500 metres), but the most prominent feature is the massive  Taurus  (Toros) mountain system, running parallel to the Mediterranean coast and extending along the southern border. There crest lines are often above 8,000 feet (2,400 metres), and several peaks exceed 11,000 feet (3,400 metres). [P8] \n In the eastern third of the country, the northern and southern fold systems converge to produce an extensive area of predominantly mountainous terrain, with pockets of relatively level land confined to valleys and enclosed basins, as are found around  Malatya ,  Elaz\xc4\xb1\xc4\x9f , and  Mu\xc5\x9f .
