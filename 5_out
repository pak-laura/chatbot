The Eurasian nation of Turkey is a \'constitutional, secular, democratic republic\'. The Turkish version of its name - "T\xc3\xbcrkiye"- is derived from the amalgamation of two words - "T\xc3\xbcrk"and the suffix "-iye". The former simply means \'strong\', while the suffix is possessive in nature and pertains to being an \'owner\'. The nation of Turkey was concretely established by Mustafa Kemal Atat\xc3\xbcrk, in 1923, subsequently to Ottoman decline. The part of the country that lies in Asia is called Anatolia while the European section is called Thrace. Turkey is a trans-continental nation, half of it being in Asia and another half in Europe. So it can be called a Eurasian country. Turkey has a diverse landscape of coasts, mountains, plains and peninsulas. The Anatolian peninsula is almost a national trademark, with its stark ruggedness and aridity it rises to a plateau surrounded by contracted coastal plains. The country of Turkey is comprises of seven sections based on the region it surrounds or the region that surrounds it. They are the Aegean region, the Marmara region, the Mediterranean region, East Anatolia, Central Anatolia, Southeast Anatolia and the Black Sea region. There are mountain ranges in the east that are the birth places for many a river, namely the Euphrates, Tigris, Araks and also Lake Van. The highest point in Turkey is Mount Arat. Where is Turkey The land of Turkey lies spread out across the southern region of two continents - east of Europe and west of Asia. As a result it also covers two significant landscapes - the Anatolian peninsula and the Balkans. Its immediate political and watery neighbors are (clockwise from the west) Armenia, Iran and Azerbaijan to the east; Iraq and Syria to southeast; the Mediterranean Sea to the south; the Aegean Sea to the southwest; the Sea of Marmara and the country of Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; and the Black Sea to the north. Climate of Turkey Turkey has clement weather almost the whole year round. It can be summed up in the phrase \'Mediterranean\'. Summers are hot and dry, while the winters are wet and cold. However, inland-wards, the conditions get arid and continental, with demarcated seasonal changes, due to the mountainous barrier near the coast. Precipitation in the form of snowfall is experienced inland at higher altitudes. The month of May experiences the most rainfall.
